One day a bolt of lightning struck my house (again) and fried my internet router, so I was left without access to the internet for a day until I could get a new one. I was left without a way to properly do things like finances offline.

So I came up with this. A perfect excuse to test out building service workers that handle transactions and such offline and then update them to the server when the internet is inevitably restored, without losing anything you've done.

With a handy little thing like this, in theory, no one will be left in my internetless situation and lose/be prevented from working on their important things, such as finances. (Finances are an easy concept for the layman to grasp.)

While creating this, I learned more about service workers and offline handling. But I also learned how annoying MONGO can be when hooking things up to Heroku.
